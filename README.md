# MILKCRATE

**Digitize Your Vinyl Collection**

## Description

MILKCRATE is designed to simplify the management of vinyl record collections by digitizing them, adding a social layer for users to connect. This platform offers various features to transfer vinyls to the digital world, including 'Add Record,' 'Add Friends,' and 'Add Spins.' The 'Add Spins' feature allows users to log a spin session, capturing insights into their recent plays. 'Latest Listens' and 'Hot Off the Press' sections enable users to discover what their friends have been listening to and purchasing. By leveraging MILKCRATE, vinyl enthusiasts can effortlessly manage their collections and share their musical tastes with friends.
